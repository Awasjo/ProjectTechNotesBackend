# Technotes Backend

inspiration from https://github.com/gitdagray/mern_stack_course

mongoose deprecated version so that the counter works as expected 
npm i express-async-error can be used instead of async handler that we used, all you need to do is require in app.js like env require

the result is deployed over here: https://technotes-api-rm77.onrender.com/
